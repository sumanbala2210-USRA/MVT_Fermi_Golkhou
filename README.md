# MVTfermi: Minimum Variability Timescale Analysis for Fermi GBM (or GBM like) Data

**MVTfermi** is a Python package designed to calculate the Minimum Variability Timescale (MVT) for Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). It analyzes time-binned light curve data to identify the shortest statistically significant timescales on which source flux changes occur, distinguishing these from Poisson noise.
